At a minimum, this should `explain what it does, list its dependencies, and provide sufficiently detailed instructions on how to use it. You want to make it as simple as possible for others to understand the purpose of your project, and quickly get something working`.\n",

Writing this documentation can also help you improve the design of your code, as you're forced to think through your design decisions more thoroughly. This also allows future contributors to know how to follow your original intentions."
